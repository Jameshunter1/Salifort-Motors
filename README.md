# Employee Attrition Prediction and Analysis at Salifort Motors

## Project Overview

The HR department at Salifort Motors seeks to enhance employee satisfaction levels within the company. They have collected data from employees and enlisted the help of a data analytics professional to provide data-driven suggestions. The primary question is: What factors are likely to contribute to an employee leaving the company? The goal of this project is to analyze the collected data and build a predictive model that can identify employees likely to leave. Identifying such employees can help in understanding the contributing factors and ultimately lead to strategies for improving employee retention.

## Business Understanding

Employee turnover can be a significant challenge for companies, impacting productivity, morale, and overall organizational performance. The objective of this project is to predict employee attrition at Salifort Motors, allowing the company to proactively address potential issues and improve retention strategies. Research in employee satisfaction and turnover rates within the industry will be incorporated to provide context and insights.

## Data Understanding

The analysis is based on the data collected by the HR department, which includes information about employees' demographics, job roles, performance metrics, and satisfaction surveys. The timeframe of the data will be specified, and any limitations in the dataset will be addressed. Exploratory data analysis visualizations will be presented to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

## Modeling and Evaluation

Various machine learning models will be employed to predict employee attrition. The selection of models will be based on their suitability for the problem at hand, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score will be used to assess model performance. The process of model development, training, and testing will be detailed in this section.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, recommendations will be provided based on the insights gained from the analysis. The project aims to offer actionable strategies to improve employee satisfaction and retention. Future steps, including potential enhancements to the model or additional analyses, will be highlighted to further advance the understanding of employee attrition factors and refine the predictive capabilities of the model.
